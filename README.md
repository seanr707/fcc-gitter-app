# Gitter App for FreeCodeCamp
*Authored by Sean R. [(@seanr707)](https://github.com/seanr707)*

### About project

This project was written mainly for educational purposes in mind. It was inpsired
by my own issues with the official Gitter client using a lot of processing power
and not loading well on my home Internet.

The project aims to showcase the use of an external API, Oauth login,
a clean minimal UX, React/Redux UI and state management.

#### What currently works:
* Login using Gitter oauth
* Use Gitter API to send and receive messages from other users
* Notifications upon receiving a message
* Access to several FreeCodeCamp chat rooms

#### Currently WIP:
* Sidebar to select room
* Client-side markdown and emoticon support
* Autocompleting mentions
* All FreeCodeCamp chat rooms
* Building database on the server storing users' brownie points

#### Possible future additions:
* Build desktop app with Electron
* Accessing FreeCodeCamp API for brownie points (once API is public)
